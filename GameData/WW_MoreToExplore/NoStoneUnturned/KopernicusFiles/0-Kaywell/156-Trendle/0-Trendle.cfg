			description = 156 Trendle is a quasisatellite of Wers-Vizea, and remarkably, it is also a binary. What is it with this particular part of the system and proportionally huge moons!?
			//description = For as long as charts of the stars have existed, Trendle has stood out among the notable moons of Limnus. Being the only notable moon that appears as only a mere dot in the sky, the only moon that orbits Limnus clockwise, in an orbit that is heavily elliptical and tilted to the other moons. With the dawn of astronomy some few hundred years ago, Trendle began to show other strange traits. A feature that long alluded stargazers prior to the invention of the telescope was Trendles apparent "blinking," with seemingly no relation to its orbital period, Trendle's brightness rises and falls over time. Armed with new equipment, early astronomers were able to quickly identify the cause of this blinking, unlike other moons of Limnus, Trendle spins freely. As this elongated moon rotates, the amount of light it reflects back at us changes. Trendle's shape was first described as capsule by Galgaeus Kerman, but later observations further refined Trendle's shape as conical, and then further to a sort of "lobed" shape. As the shape was further constrained by further observations, the discovery of Trendle's most distinctive feature followed closely behind.
