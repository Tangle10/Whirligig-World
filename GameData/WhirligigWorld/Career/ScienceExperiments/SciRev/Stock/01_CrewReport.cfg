				InSpaceLow = You start to check off the checkbox for "very hot" when a drop of sweat stains the box for you.
				InSpaceLow = Things are getting a little stuffy in here, though at this distance you can easily make out Kaywell and Limnel separately.
				InSpaceHigh = As you drift between the planets, you reflect on the nature of Kerbalkind and what they are doing in deep space.
				InSpaceHigh = You realize, with dread, that you have forgotten your toothbrush. It's a long time until you can find it again.

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Shol
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You glance out the window, then at the altimeter. Shol is enormous! You try to picture Mesbin beside the giant planet.
				InSpaceLow = Shol's clouds appear to be glowing red. And, it should be noted, so are parts of your spacecraft.
				Flying = There's a lot of temperature warnings going off right now.
			}

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Jifgif
			Values
			{

				InSpaceLow = You are involved in a long, drawn out argument with mission control over the pronounciation of this minor satellite.
				InSpaceHigh = The minor moon appears to be composed of two smaller satellites that have stuck together. Or possibly there's some more complex structural failure involved?
			}

			name = WW/Imterril
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The moon is a lovely blue shade.

				InSpace = This moon is so intensely bright! It almost appears to glow on its own.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Etrograd
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = You search for landing sights. Those curvy cliffs do not look particularly fun, but some of the large craters look flat enough.
				SrfLanded = There's a faint gray haze near the horizon!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Aerious
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = It'd be pretty easy to bury the spacecraft under some of the smaller chunks.
				InSpace = The moon is covered in large bumps, and it's so stretched out that you're having trouble figuring out what's vertical and what's horizontal--choosing a landing sight might be hard.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Wers
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The horizon on this tiny world is so much closer than it ought to be--you feel mislead.

				InSpaceLowSaltDeposits = Little white spots there. Probably just salt, but it'd be cool if it were ice.
				InSpaceLowThreeCones = Three cone-shaped mountains are now visible. Could they be volcanic in origin?

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Vizea
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The surface is fairly rugged from up here, you watch carefully to pick out a good landing site--the steep slopes in the middle latitudes may not be the best bet.
				InSpaceHigh = Vizea is highly oblate, but it rotates very slowly. Perhaps at one point Vizea rotated very quickly, before it was tidally locked to Wers? If so, it means Vizea had at one point been in hydrostatic equilibrium, but it certainly is not any longer.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Mesbin
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = The big gray oval of Mesbin, surrounded by the dots and circles of its moons, is quite the sight.
				InSpaceLow = The ground seems to crawl by compared to the speeding star field in the background.
				FlyingHigh = Yep. There's Mesbin down there. We're still below stable orbital altitude.

				SrfLandedPolarMetal = It'd be easier to stick to the ground if we had a big magnet.
				SrfLandedPolarRust = The apparent gravity here completely disagrees with the angle of the surface. Centrifugal force is a hell of a thing.
			}
		}

		{
			name = WW/Graymun
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You look down at the cold gray surface. It looks really beat up with craters.
				InSpace = You survey the gray moon from space, looking for a decent landing site. The maria seem like the best bet.
				InSpace = There's such a specific feeling about the inner Mesbin system worlds--those first mountains to be summitted--Statmun, Thresomin, Graymun... These sort of, dull color worlds that mimic their planetary parent, lifeless, dusty, even gloomy... and yet: Full of wonder in their own right
				SrfLanded = All you can see out the window is magnificent desolation.

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Troymin

				SrfLandedMaria = Cabin temperature is rising, the air conditioning is having a tough time keeping up.
				SrfLandedMidlands = Internal conditions here are nominal. You feel a bit heavy, but perhaps that's just because you've been slacking off in low gravity for a while.
				SrfLandedContinents = Internal conditions here are nominal. You feel a bit heavy, but perhaps that's just because you've been slacking off in low gravity for a while.
				SrfLandedHighlands = Internal conditions here are nominal. You feel a bit heavy, but perhaps that's just because you've been slacking off in low gravity for a while. You notice that the indicator light for the heater has been flickering.

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Oshan
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedIcelands = The surface is fairly fragile, shifting slightly under the weight of the spacecraft. You question the decision to touch down here.

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Manonam
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = You think you just saw another minor moon out of the window.

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Rik

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Reander
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = You watch the swirls of cream and red from a distance. It's just like Gaffald Heights Observatory back home, but less fuzzy.
				InSpaceLow = Reander has quickly revealed itself as an enormous mass of enormity and largeness. 10/10.
				FlyingHigh = You're not sure this is wise...

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lito
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Reander and Lito are waaaaay too close. How does this thing even stay together? You take out your paper and pen and calculate the roche limit. "Checks out," you think.

			}
		}
		Body

			}

				InSpaceHigh = As you drift between the planets, you reflect on the nature of Kerbalkind and what they are doing in deep space.
				InSpaceHigh = You realize, with dread, that you have forgotten your toothbrush. It's a long time until you can find it again.
				InSpaceHigh = Travelling through deep space being the intensely boring subject it is, you record in your log that the situation is more or less nominal, and get back to your game of computer-aided 3D Multi-Chess with Mission Control and the other astronauts. At this distance, the lag time is getting pretty annoying. Maybe you can start your own 3D Multi-Chess game.
				InSpaceHigh = Travelling through deep space gives you a lot of time to sit around and think. You wonder what they're doing back home. Not your home. Kerbin.
				InSpaceHigh = You write down some visual observations of Gememma--with protection of course--and sketch out the features you see.

				LowelInSpaceHigh = You watch Lowel and Ollym carefully, taking note of their respective features and appearances. Ollym is a fairly normal looking desert planet--though covered in huge bumpy mountains, but Lowel is particularly strange.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Gannovar
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Gannovar is a phenomenal off-white and blue marble hanging in the sky below you.

				SrfSplashedEquatorialOcean = The spacecraft is rated for several atmospheres of pressure, but you're not sure how many oceans it's rated for.
				SrfSplashedOceanHotspots = There's a distinct lack of glaciers in these waters. It must be significantly warmer. You realize that this is one of two spots where Gememma is directly overhead at periapsis, due to its spin-locked rotation.
			}
		}
		Body
		{

			Values
			{
				InSpace = Ollym is a fairly normal looking desert planet--or it would be, were it not for the huge roughly circular bulges covering its surface.
