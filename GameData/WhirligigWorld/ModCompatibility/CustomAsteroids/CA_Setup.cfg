{
	@UseKopernicusAsteroidSystem = False //String with three valid values, True,False, and Stock.  True means use the old customizable Kopernicus asteroid generator with no comet support (many packs use this so it's the default).  False means don't generate anything, or wait for an external generator.  Stock means use the internal games generator, which supports comets, but usually only works well in stock based systems with Dres and Kerbin present.
