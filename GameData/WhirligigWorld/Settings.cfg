{
	
	Homeworld = Mesbin
	
	//pick between Mesbin, Kerbmun, or Derbin.
	//default is Mesbin.
	//I highly recommend playing with Mesbin, it's a really fun challenge to play in this wacky homeworld.
	//However, if you REALLY want a more down-to-earth gameplay, let's rewrite history so that the colonists DID land on Kerbmun with a certain degree of success. They crashed their ship and lost their technology, but at least they made it to Kerbmun intact.
	//Derbin is now included as well as a hard-mode option. There are no unique science definitions or descriptions at this time.
	//If you switch the homeworld, switch MesbinExosphere to False; you won't need it.
	
	//---IF YOU'RE USING INTERSTELLAR CONSORTIUM AND WANT TO SWITCH TO KERBMUN---
	//You will also have to go in the IC settings add homePlanet = Kerbmun.
	//By default the homePlanet = Kerbin setting is commented out. If it isn't, change the existing homePlanet = setting to target Kerbmun.
	//And make sure you're using WW/Kaywell as the home star, both for Kerbmun and for Mesbin based space programs.
	
	//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	MesbinExosphere = False
	//---------YOU MUST SET THIS TO TRUE TO START CAREER MODE ON MESBIN----------
	//or else you will not be able to complete the "First Spaceflight" and "Return from Orbit" contracts, and possibly more.
	
	//Pick either True or False.
	//default is True.
	//When set to False, the atmosphere will be limited to the atmosphere over the North Polar Basin.
	//When set to True, the atmosphere will go up to about 1980 meters above Mesbin Space Center, or 970,000 meters above the datum/sealevel.
	//...However, almost all of it will be vacuum, hence "exosphere."
	//Once you've completed the "First Spaceflight" contract, you can set this to False before your next restart, or at any other time.
	//Just be sure to turn it back on when you start your next career mode!
	
	//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	MesbinShape = Blend
	
	//default is Blend.
	//Pick between Blend, PointEquipotential, Classic, and ClassicTexture.
	//This will slightly change some science definitions to match.
	//Blend:	Real planets are neither point masses nor have uniform density.
	//			The blended shape preserves the dimensions and properties of the original Mesbin, while giving it a slightly lenticular figure.
	//			The gravity won't be level everywhere like with PointEquipotential, but it should be closer to level than Classic.
	//			This version is also a good guess at what Mesbin would be like if it were real.
	//PointEquipotential:	Useful for rover trips to high latitudes. Uses VertexHeightOblateAdvanced to generate a surface which is level everywhere. 
	//						The resulting shape is a lenticular object which is not as wide as the original Mesbin.
	//						Mesbin's polar radius and gravity are preserved, as is its equatorial gravity.
	//						However the rotation period is only 1204 seconds instead of 1701 seconds.
	//						Transfer delta-v to the moons will be higher due to starting deep in a gravity well. 
	//						I think it actually might end up being less delta-v for some interplanetary transfers though.
	//Classic:	Uses VertexHeightOblateAdvanced to generate an oblate spheroid shape that closesly matches the original shape of the planet.
	//			Represents a Mesbin with a uniform mass distribution.
	//ClassicTexture:	Not recommended. Backwards compatibility mode. Uses a heightmap ellipsoid.png to generate the oblate spheroid shape. Leads to ring-shaped artifacts at higher latitudes.

	//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	KaywellBarycenter = False
	
	//Pick either True or False.
	//default is False.
	//When set to False, Kaywell will have 1.7 Solar Masses and will be the center of the system.
	//When set to True, Kaywell will have the realistic 1.17 Solar Masses and will be in a binary orbit with Limnel.
	//I don't recommend ever trying to enter the SOIs of Kaywell and Limnel with this set to true, since the behavior will be glitchy.
	//Note that when Principia is installed, Kaywell will have the realistic 1.17 Solar Masses and will be at the center of the system.
	//YOU MUST SET THIS TO FALSE TO PLAY WITH PRINCIPIA.
	
	//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	RealisticAsteroids = True
	
	//Pick either True or False.
	//default is True.
	//When set to False, the densities of the new asteroid types will be divided by 100 to bring them more in line with stock asteroids,
	//and the sizes of asteroids will be reset to the stock scales
	//Does not apply to Diddmun.
	
	//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	ScaledClouds = True
	
	//Pick either True or False
	//Default is True
	//When set to True, Derbin and Imterril will have clouds painted onto their scaledspace maps, disappearing within the atmosphere.
	//When set to False, the default blue ocean texture is used for Imterril and the default planet map is used for Derbin.
	//This option is automatically disabled if Environmental Visual Enhancements is installed.
	
	//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	OblateGiants = False
	
	//Pick either True or False.
	//default is False.
	//When set to True, Tyepolbynar and Reander will be deformed and slightly oblate.
	//This setting is sort of incompatible with E.V.E.. Cloud maps will still be spherical.
	//This setting is also completely incompatible with Scatterer.
	
	//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	StarColors = Default
	
	//Pick either Colorful or Default
	//default is Default.
	//When set to Colorful, it will use the physically based colors on the thermal spectrum, 
	// but since it's not white balanced, Gememma may look unpleasantly orange.
	//When set to Default, the color values are all halfway between true-white and Colorful. I believe this is closest to how it would really look.
	
	//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	KronometerMode = MesbinKerbin
	
	//Pick MesbinClassic, MesbinKerbin, MesbinEarth, Mesbin28, MesbinMoons, or Kerbmun.
	//Default is MesbinKerbin.
	//Requires the Kronometer plugin to be installed to do anything.
	//This setting will determine which clock system is used.
	//MesbinClassic: 1 day is equivalent to 1 hour, with 40 40-second long moments making up each day. 1.063125 seconds per second.
	//MesbinKerbin: 1 Fortnight is split up into 6 hours, with 60 minutes per hour and 60 seconds per minute. 1.1025 seconds per second.

	//MesbinMoons: Same as MesbinEarth, but the year is replaced with a Duoyear which lasts 10 earth-months or 2 mesbin-years. A Derbin month calendar is also provided. 0.984499707 seconds per second.
	//Kerbmun: 1 day is equal to the Kerbmun day, split into 30 hours, with 60 minutes per hour, 60 seconds per minute. 1.0093714 seconds per second.
	
	//RSS-scale options are also available if you're playing at EXACTLY 10x Resize and Rescale using Sigma Dimensions
	//with the day length rescale set to SQRT[10] = 3.16227766. In this case, 1 Mesbin day will be about 5379.0343 seconds long.
	//Pick RSSMesbin, RSSMesbin-90, or RSSKerbmun.
	//RSSMesbin: 1 Fortnight is split up into 21 hours, with 60 minutes per hour and 60 seconds per minute. 0.996117463 seconds per second.
	//RSSMesbin-90: 1 day is split up into 90 minutes and 60 seconds per minute. Every 14 days is a fortnight. 0.99611746296 seconds per second.
	//RSSKerbmun: 1 day is equal to the Kerbmun day, split up into 96 hours, with 60 minutes per hour and 60 seconds per minute. 0.997472693 seconds per second.

	//with the day length rescale set to SQRT[2.56] = 1.60. In this case, 1 Mesbin day will be exactly 2721.6 seconds long.
	//Pick TATSMesbin, TATSMesbin45, or TATSKerbmun.
	//TATSMesbin: 1 Dozenight is split up into 9 hours, with 60 minutes per hour and 60 seconds per minite. 1.0080 seconds per second.
	//TATSMesbin45: 1 day is split up into 45 minutes and 60 seconds per minute. Every 14 days is a fortnight. 1.0080 seconds per second.
	//TATSKerbmun: 1 day is equal to the Kerbmun day, split up into 48 hours, with 60 minutes per hour and 60 seconds per minute. 0.995712867 seconds per second.
