It is believed it has not seen sunlight in thousands of years, and astronomers eagerly await its close pass of the Suns, where they expect to see a cometary tail. Mountain-dwellers, if you chance upon a bought of clear weather, try to take a look for the so-called comet!

			%description = 1 Wers is the first major asteroid--and dwarf planet--discovered in the Kaywell star system, although due to Vizea's brighter albedo it has been argued that it was actually Vizea that was discovered first. Due to the confusion involved, both bear the minor planet number "1." Wers and Vizea are thought to be protoplanetary remnants from the formation of the Kaywell System, as its position within the Lagrange-4 point of Mesbin indicates very long-term stability.

		@Properties
		{
			%description = Vizea is the large minor planet moon of 1 Wers. Vizea's apparent brightness is actually brighter than Wers' because of its higher albedo, so it has been argued that Vizea should have the name Wers because it was the primary visual component of the Wers-Vizea system. Because of the confusion involved, Vizea does not carry a satellite designation, but instead shares the Minor Planet Number "1." The two are considered a double minor planet. Considered a likely candidate for an original Protoplanet, Vizea may help answer the question of how the planets formed.

			%description = The second minor planet of the Kaywell system to be discovered, 2 Wolda is also the brightest, and is in fact visible to the naked eye if you are very carefully looking towards Kaywell near Shol. Its existence was firmly suspected after a terminally ill solar astronomer Bilburry Kerman detected a faint, tiny object transiting Kaywell. After calculating a possible trajectory, he marked it down in his book, noting that it was unlikely to transit Kaywell before he were to die. Many telescope cameras were burnt out searching for Bulburry's asteroid, and occasionally it would be detected and lost again as its orbit could never be reasonably tracked. Finally, the mathematician Jinbat Kerman proved that all orbits that close to Shol would be at least a little bit chaotic, and found that Wolda was in a chaotic but dynamically stable orbit around Kaywell within the 9:5 mean motion resonance, and Bilburry was able to see his asteroid confirmed before he died unrelatedly to his illness in a tragic oxygen tank explosion.

It orbits very near Tyepolbynar in a circular orbit, implying that it formed alongside Tyepolbynar's large moons, and therefore may be rocky. The planet's name is the subject of vehement debate among the Kerbmun Astronomical Society, with some Kerbals insisting the name be pronounced "Jif Gif" and others "Jif Jif." The astronomer who discovered and named Jifgif, unfortunately, passed away during the filming of a silent documentary about peanut butter, and as such could not be reached for comment.

It has a distinct bluish tint, leading some astronomers to believe that despite its proximity to the Sun, Imterril is a habitable oceanic world. During transits of Tyepolbynar and its satellites across the face of Kaywell, astronomers have detected water in the planet's extremely large atmosphere, lending credence to the ocean notion.

Its orbit is very difficult to predict, but it appears unlikely to actually escape Tyepolbynar within the next few hundred years at least. Taking better and more accurate readings of its mass, interactions with the other satellites, and position over time is of utmost importance, for if Aerious escapes Tyepolbynar, it could possibly intersect Mesbin's--and even Kerbmun's--orbit.

The new weather, which they call Mesbin, seems a great World in its own right, as talle as Derbin but almost twice as wide. It spins at a Cadence of 1,701 seconds, and with such precision it may be possible to learn to keep time with it. Initially wondered to be a Stationary Satellite, further Refinements of the meterological measurementes have confirmed the Inverse: Derbin orbits not the Suns as previously thought, but Mesbin.

	@Body[Statmun]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Statmun was discovered by meteorologists who were trying to map the continents of Mesbin. They noticed that once every rotation of Mesbin, a little red-brown speck would cross the face of Mesbin. Since it always maintained the exact same position above the surface, it was in a sense "static" compared to Mesbin. As such, they gave it the apt name of Statmun. Statmun is so close to Mesbin that it would have to be extremely dense or rigid for it to not be torn apart by the latter's gravity.
		}
	}
	@Body[Thresomin]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Thresomin was discovered by astronomers mapping the continents of Mesbin. Once exactly every three Mesbin rotations, a star-like object would be seen to one edge of Mesbin, and with sufficient resolving power it could be observed transiting the face of Mesbin. This turned out to be an object orbiting in a 3:1 resonance with Mesbin's rotation and Statmun's orbit. Thresomin is a polarizing object for many astronomers and astronomy educators. When it was discovered, it was hailed as the sixth moon of Mesbin. However, around the same time, astronomers were discovering many, many small moonlets in orbits quite similar to Thresomin. Those moonlets, now understood to be a diffuse ring system left over from the destruction of Statmun's compositional parent body, show similar spectral characteristics to Thresomin--rich in silicates and metals as well as hints of volatile ices. While it is certainly the largest of these objects to date, it is not yet agreed upon by astronomers whether this is simply the largest moonlet or the smallest moon--a problem paralleled in discussions of certain dwarf planets orbiting Kaywell. Its name means "Small Object in Three-To-One Resonance."

Of particular interest are the darker flat regions on Graymun, which seem to be less cratered. Using a large telescope from Kerbmun's surface, individual impact craters can be resolved covering the surface, except in the dark grey maria.

			%description = Kerbmun is one of a rare type of worlds: habitable, wet, living planets. Once thought to be unique in the cosmos, it is now understood that these Kerbin-like worlds are rare, but still cherished. Kerbmun is not as lush as the ancestral Kerbin, with its life largely concentrated in the vast salty oceans of the planet, though tall grass-like plants are known to populate the lands of this world. Kerbmun was settled by a crashed colony ship, the U.S.C. Magnificent Desolation, which came from the Kerbol system just over sixteen hundred Mesbin-years ago. Slowly building up their civilization within tents and structures made out of the wrecked ship, the Kerbal colonists found themselves right at home. Despite the fact that the ship had crashed, the colonization mission was overall a success, with a thriving, near limitless supply of the eager green creatures. It could have been a lot worse!

			%description = Troymin is one of the smaller satellites, and the second to last, to be discovered orbiting Mesbin. It appears in the sky as a bright star-like dot always locked in the same part of the sky, always 60 degrees of arc away from Mesbin. It is a shame that Statmun was already in popular use when this satellite was discovered! Telescopic views reveal it to be an irregularly shaped world, possibly with some volatile elements.

	}
	@Body[Derbin]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = The largest and furthest satellite of Mesbin, and arguably a planet in its own right, Derbin is practically the opposite of Mesbin. While they are both massive terrestrial planets, the similarities end there. Derbin is tidally locked to Mesbin, and so it rotates very slowly over the course of its orbit. Since it was never over-spun, it never lost its thick atmosphere, and retains a dense, reflective cloud cover. The clouds obscure the surface features of Derbin, making it very difficult to map the world, but it is not likely that there exists a particularly friendly environment on the other side of the cloud deck anyway--but who knows? For all we know, a vast planetary rainforest awaits any space probe that braves the journey!

			%description = Derbin's innermost satellite (arguably a sub-satellite or "moonmoon"), Derminmus is a small brown dot visible in the sky near Derbin. When viewed through a telescope, green "oceans" are visible on the surface. This has led some gastronomical fiction authors to propose that Derminmus is in fact one massive chocolate-minty treat, and that a manned expedition to this satellite to prove the theory is one of the most important goals of any space program.

	@Body[Dermun]

		@Properties
		{
			%description = Derbin's largest satellite (arguably a sub-satellite or "moonmoon"), Dermun was long considered an enigmatic mystery. What secrets might Derbin be hiding on that tantalizing greenish-brown disk which can barely be resolved by Kerbal eyes? Telescopes have revealed at least a partial answer: Dermun and Graymun appeared to be two of a kind. When sufficiently magnified, both worlds revealed intensely cratered highlands and flatter darker lowlands which invoke oceans or seas. Perhaps by studying Dermun and Graymun together, insights may be gained about the entire Mesbin-Derbin system! On the other hand, the greenish tint is suspicious when compared to Derminmus. It may be worth checking if there's mint or perhaps pistachio flavoring here, too.

	@Body[Valyr]

		@Properties
		{
			%description = Valyr appears as a small blue dot to the naked eye, but is in fact a huge supermassive terrestrial planet, seven times the mass of Kerbmun. The planet appears to have white clouds and blue oceans, with some smaller permanent features--landmasses and islands. Given the presence of liquid water, it is considered a high-priority secondary colony location. However, its atmosphere is not as well-studied as Kerbmun's, and it is not known whether or not the planet's atmosphere is breathable, or even toxic. Some scientists have suggested that Valyr's atmosphere must be rich in greenhouse gases, or else the water would freeze. Others suggest the water may have a significant amount of ammonia dissolved into it, working as an antifreeze to keep it extremely cold and still liquid. One thing for sure, it's definitely got more readily accessible water than anything else outside of Kerbmun.\n\nValyr is adorned by a satellite system rivalling Mesbin's in complexity, and uniquely, rings. Though some, *ahem*, "astronomers" have proposed that these rings are some kind of orbital megastructure developed by intelligent aliens native to the planet, most planetary scientists agree these are more likely some kind of debris disk, like a denser version of Mesbin's dust disk.

In culinary science, Plaph is a way of cooking a potato by stuffing it inside the belly of a Gushweed fish, a native of the equatorial seas of Kerbmun. The Gushweed Fish is then cooked from the outside, leaving behind a very flavorful skin on the new treat, which is called a Plaphoglin. For more information, contact the Kerbmun Gastronomical Society.

	@Body[Oshan]

			%description = Oshan was the first satellite of Valyr to be discovered, and the only one to be discovered non-telescopically. Oshan is bright and reflective, but so close to Valyr that it is usually hard to tell one apart from the other. It was discovered by Chriswayan Kerman, famous fictional world-builder and eccentric amateur astronomer. After conclusively determining that Oshan was in fact a satellite of Valyr, he purchased a large telescope in an attempt to observe the satellite. What he--and many astronomers after him as well--found, was a white world with dark spots of a reddish-brown color. He supposed that these were oceans of some reddish volatile fluid floating on a bright icy moon. Other astronomers proposed that it might be huge continents drifting across a frozen ocean--giving rise to Oshan's name.

A small dark rocky object with hints of white caps on the poles, Manonam is supposed to have an atmosphere, or at least have had an atmosphere some time in the recent past. Manonam was named for the mythological son of the sea god Valyr, who was said to be cursed always to speak in palindromes.

			%description = Didd, named for the mythical double-edged sword of the ocean lord Manonam, is an extremely tiny minor subsatellite of the Valyrian satellite Manonam. Very little is known about Didd due to its small size, which is barely ten times broader than an E-class miniature asteroid. It is not visible in most telescopes, and was only made possible due to very-long-exposure photography of Manonam that was taken in order to try to detect evidence of an aurora--the study was inconclusive. The photographs had a razor-thin, faint ring around the moon, indicating the presence of either a subsatellite or a small ring. Subsequent photographs detected shorter arcs around the moon, implying that it was in fact a subsatellite and not a ring.

	@Body[Egad]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Egad, a pale reddish dot to the naked eye, was renamed from the original "Adjar" to reflect the surprising discovery of ice caps on the planet's surface, which caused astronomer and certified rich man Billy-bobrik to shout out "Egad!" in exclamation during the first public unveiling of the Billy-Bobrik Observatory. The planet's ice caps are of unknown composition, but appear to occupy the vast majority of the planet's surface, with only a small strip of reddish brown desert near the equator. The edges of Egad appear to have a slight green tint.

	}
	@Body[Yeerbor]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Yeerbor is a fairly large minor moon of Egad, orbiting in a peculiar eccentric orbit. This orbit takes it from just above the roche limit--the altitude at which it would be torn apart into a ring--out to over a dozen times that distance. The light curve period of Yeerbor and the observed rotation period of Egad are aligned, which implies that they are mutually tidally locked. However, Yeerbor's orbital period is 3.5 times longer than that, implying that some very peculiar tidal dynamics are at play here.

	@Body[Reander]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Reander is the outermost major planet of Kaywell, and is a giant planet composed of Hydrogen and Helium. Reander seems to be fairly typical of algorithmicaly-modeled solar systems, where gas giants tend to form only in the outer solar system. It is a lovely brown, white, and red banded appearance, with subtle swirls visible to ground-based telescopes. Reander's orbit is quite eccentric due to perturbations from Gememma.
		}
	}
	@Body[Lito]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Lito is Reander's largest satellite, and the second largest satellite in the Kaywellian System (not counting Rutherford). It is easily seen through telescopes as a disk nearby the disk of Reander, and can be observed to transit Reander. Lito is close enough to Reander that despite its relatively minuscule mass, it tidally locks Reander to itself and causes noticeable wobble in the giant planet. Lito is a pale brown color, which could imply a rocky composition, but it could also be due to dark carbon compounds and space-weathering of the ice. Some astronomers have suggested that Lito and Reander could share the same atmospheric composition due to their proximity, others point out that Lito is not massive enough to hold onto a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere.
		}
	}
	@Body[Yalthe]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Yalthe is the second satellite of Reander, orbiting considerably further out than Lito. It appears to glow brightly in the infrared, suggesting that there could be some tidal heating occurring within the planet, possibly due to the constantly shifting gravitational field produced by Lito.
		}
	}
	@Body[Yokane]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Like Yalthe, Yokane glows in the infrared, though not as brightly. It has a higher albedo as well, suggesting the presence of ice on the surface. Interactions between Reander, Lito, Yalthe, and itself may drive internal heating that could produce some considerable geological activity.
		}
	}
	@Body[Dakkon]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Dakkon is the fourth satellite of Reander, and is very reflective, suggesting a lot of new surface ice. Planetary scientists have suggested that Dakkon could harbour a liquid water ocean even larger in volume than Kerbmun's oceans, though it may be locked under kilometers of ice. Other astronomers maintain that Dakkon must surely be geologically inactive due to its distance from Reander.
		}
	}
	@Body[Totooa]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Totooa is the second largest satellite of Reander, and appears to have a darker color than Dakkon, more comparable to Lito. As a result, it is probably geologically dead, and old. Astronomers Mandrake and Rutherford, working from the Mount Arror Binocular Observatory, noticed the presence of rim brightening on the edges of the satellite, indicating the possible presence of an atmosphere.
		}
	}
	@Body[Mally]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Mally was the last moon of Reander to be discovered. It was discovered when astronomers at the Graggenfort Heights Observatory noticed that they couldn't take a nice picture of Totooa to hang up in their office without a little red speck appearing nearby. After checking the equipment thoroughly, replacing all of the telescope's optics, and getting their eyes all checked, they realized that the speck must in fact be a satellite. The satellite was named Mally, after a fictional character in classic Kerbmunatic literature who was able to hide in plain sight by shrinking to the size of a small pebble.
		}
	}
	@Body[Yawer]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Yawer is one of the stranger satellites. It was incredibly frustrating for astronomers because at first, they could not consistently observe the satellite, and therefore could not conclusively prove its existence or calculate its orbit. One moment it would be there, then they'd come back again to find it had disappeared! Having had enough of this mysterious ghost satellite, Durderry Galibash the Third Kerman spent several nights continuously observing Reander and searching for the satellite. He finally discovered Yawer when he realized that the object was rotating rapidly and has a dark spot on one side. Yawer was named for the old Driddish word for "Blinker." The Blinking, of course, comes from a 47 minute rotation period--the second fastest in the system after Mesbin!--and a region of very dark terrain on one side. Yawer probably has an oblate shape similar to Mesbin, as it would be large enough to be spherical if it weren't rotating.

	//Gememma System
	@Body[Gememma]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Gememma was long thought to be the distant red giant star Rodocer, a well known star visible from the ancestral Kerbol system. Early Kerbmun explorers would use it for longitudinal navigation, and get confused why they kept being led off course every few years after a correction to the star map was made. Annoyed by these constant navigation errors, navigator and early astronomer Gememma Kerman decided to measure the position of the star over time. What she found was startling. The star wasn't just moving very quickly through deep space far away from Kaywell. It was moving at exactly the right angular rate to be in orbit around Kaywell at a distance just above that of Reander. She published her results in the scientific journal "Space And Some Things To Find In It" before being lynched by angry astrologers. The star turned out to be a red dwarf star in orbit of Kaywell after all, making Kaywell a double-star system. (Though it is now known that Kaywell is in fact a triple star!) The star was renamed Gememma's Star (and Rodocer reidentified as a much more distant, dimmer star) and the gang of ravenous astrologers spent the rest of their lives in prison.

	@Body[Ammenon]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Ammenon was, counter-intuitively, the second planet to be discovered around Gememma. Before the invention of the telescope, Gememma was the subject of much study. Astronomer Annie Kerman monitored the light of Gememma with a photometer that was pointed at Gememma and left on a clock drive for several weeks. The data showed that, in addition to regular sunspots, occasional stellar flares, and occultations from Mesbin and the ground of Kerbmun, the light curve showed something unexpected--little dips in the light for a few moments at a time, with a periodicity of about ten hours. At first she thought it was some strange variability cycle of the star. Much later, astronomer Crimmenon Kerman discovered that the dip in Annie's light curves could be explained by a dwarf planet in a low orbit around Gememma. The planet carries the name Annie and Crimmenon's Planet, but since that's quite the mouthful and didn't have the benefit of a popular science fiction novel canonizing the long name, the official nickname of "Ammenon" stuck. The planet--or dwarf planet--or arguably even moon--is thought to be extremely hot.

	@Body[Lowel]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Lowel was the third planet to be discovered around Gememma. It was discovered by telescope by eccentric science communicator and amateur astronomer Lowel Kerman. The planet was at first refuted by the scientific community, as Lowel was no stranger to absurd observational claims, such as the refuted artificial canals on Egad and Oshan, and the planet Kerbiru, which he claimed to have detected on the opposite side of the Sun--impossible for obvious reasons. However, when astronomers decided to actually go and check Gememma for the described planet, it was discovered by Giovan Kerman. Giovan was considered by the astronomical community to be the true discoverer of the planet, and was going to name the planet "Desch." However, Lowel sued Giovan, believing that he deserved discovery credit and naming rights. He lost the case, since he couldn't prove that he had actually observed the object he claimed to observe. Giovan, feeling sorry for Lowel, decided to name the planet after Lowel instead--in recognition of Lowel's contribution to science communication and the inspiration for the search for planets around Gememma.

		{
			%description = Discovered by careful observations of Lowel's wobble over time, Ollym is the large planetary companion of Lowel. Very little is known about it, but the existence of Ollym puts an interesting perspective on the planet Lowel, which now must be around half the mass it was previously assumed to be, and possibly under significant tidal stress. One or both objects may be tectonically active and covered in rifts and volcanism due to the proximity of this pair.

	@Body[Gannovar]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Gannovar was the last major planet around Gememma to be discovered, despite its size and reflectivity, because lying near the plane of the Kaywell system, it was orbiting where anyone expected to find a planet. It was detected first by observing that Gememma had an unexplained periodic wobble that was very strong for a few hours, and then became weaker for several days afterwards. This turned out to be due to the presence of a major planet in an eccentric orbit. The planet has since been resolved as a bright, reflective planet. Given that it spends much of its time far from Gememma, it could plausibly be ice, however the ice would melt or boil whenever Gannovar passes near periapsis. This could mean that Gannovar has transient surface oceans!

For a long time they were simply known as The Rodocer Planet, until they were finally observed extensively by conjoined-twin astronomers Mandrake and Rutherford at the Mount Arror Binocular Observatory--the only location where the two astronomers could work together practically. They observed that the planet was in fact two giant planets. Mandrake, the larger of the two, is a similar mass to Reander, but is smaller, implying it has a higher concentration of heavier elements within.

	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Rutherford is one of the smaller giant planets known, with a mass barely greater than Derbin's. Under some definitions, Rutherford is a satellite, but its discoverers Mandrake and Rutherford Kerman maintain that Rutherford is more of a binary planet, as the two objects rotate around a common point in space called the Mandrake/Rutherford Barycenter. Like Mandrake, Rutherford is thought to be composed not just of hydrogen and helium, but heavier volatiles like water and methane. It is not as blue as Mandrake.

	@Body[Lozon]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Lozon is the innermost of the circumbinary satellites of Mandrake and Rutherford. It lies very close to the inner limit of the system. If it were to go much closer, its orbit would become unstable! Lozon, Beagrid, and Tatian are in an 11:9:6 resonance. Every eleven times Lozon completes an orbit, Beagrid completes nine orbits and Tatian completes six orbits. Lozon is the smallest of the four circumbinary satellites, and was discovered alongside Jancy. Lozon was named after the brand of coffee consumed by early Kerbmun explorers.

	@Body[Beagrid]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Beagrid is the second of the circumbinary satellites of Mandrake and Rutherford. It, alongside Tatian, were the first satellites of Mandrake and Rutherford to be discovered. Beagrid and Tatian are in a 3:2 resonance, with Beagrid completing three orbits for every two of Tatian. Beagrid is a bright, reflective color, indicating the possibility of geological activity. Quite possible, given that Mandrake and Rutherford would no doubt produce significant tidal forces on the satellites. It was named for the mother of the discoverer, Bickorabne Kerman.

	@Body[Jancy]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Jancy is the third of the circumbinary satellites of Mandrake and Rutherford. It was thought to be much smaller than the other satellites due to it being far dimmer, but a stellar occulation observation performed cooperatively between several observatories and amateur astronomers led to the discovery that Jancy was actually quite a bit larger than Lozon, it merely had a lower albedo. Jancy is not in orbital resonance. Jancy is named for the head of the Department of Recycling and Reuse, as the telescope it was discovered with was made from recycled metal and glass.

	@Body[Tatian]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Tatian is the largest of the circumbinary satellites of Mandrake and Rutherford. It is in a 2:3 resonance with Beagrid and 9:11 resonance with Lozon. Tatian was named for the Kerbal goddess of vision, Tatiana, who its discoverer Stern Kerman believed was with him the day he and his team detected Tatian.

	@Body[Pragnik]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = Pragnik was a particularly difficult object to discover on account of its extremely inclined orbit, small size, and pitiful illumination. It orbits just beyond Mandrake and Rutherford. It belongs to an ever growing class of objects of disputed planetary status--and is therefore probably a dwarf planet. Its spectrum is reddish--even when white-balanced to account for Gemmema's candle-red light--implying that it is made of organic-rich volatile ices. It was discovered by the Dolgoch Observatory staff following a fierce debate about what empty space near Gememma would look like if you just set a camera to expose on empty sky. In addition to discovering the fascinating wealth of galaxies in previously assumed empty space, by sheer chance they managed to capture a Gememma system body passing through. It did not, however, discover a Gemmeman Aether, causing Dolgoch's lead astronomer, Newfort Kerman, to lose a bet so massive that he had to resign and take up a more profitable job in agriculture in order to pay the bills.
